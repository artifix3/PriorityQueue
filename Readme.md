# Priority Queue 

Mainly this type of data structure is as same as Queue and Stack. This type is also one dimensional. And main difference is in this type we will have priority of items. 

# Stack

Stack is one of the main data structures in programming. We can see stack in our life also. For example books in a row. And our book which is in the top will be our last book is putted by us. Commonly stack look like it . It works with LIFO ( last in first out ) logic. We have a lot of methods in stack. Main of them are ( push , peek , contains , count ). Push is insert our variable ( object or etc. ) front of stack. Peek and pop are look like each other. But main difference is when we use peek it returns the first element and when we use POP method it return value also but remove it from stack. Contains return True if we have this element in our stack and false if we do not have this element in our stack . Clear delete all elements from our stack . You can check my stack repository by using this function .

## Queue 

Queue works with FIFO. First in first our. We can see queues in everywhere. In bus station, metro , supermarket and etc . The queue can contain items of the specified type. It provides compile-time type checking and does not perform boxing-out of the box because it is generic. The most methods are : Enqueue, Dequeue , Peek, Contains, Clear . 
Enqueue uses for inserting element in front of queue. Dequeue and peek is works same . But difference is peek just return value and dequeue return and remove value ( the first element) . Contains return True if we have this element in our queue and false if we do not have this element in our queue . Clear delete all elements from our queue . You can check my queue repository by using this function .

## **Priority **Queue****

 Finally we comes Priority Queue. Let's think like that we have a problem. Problem is we will have a lot of patients and we must to find which of them will go to first to room of our doctor. Every patient have one problem . And every problem can have priority level. For this problem we can use stack , queue . But they will not efficient . Maybe we can use list also . But is not will efficient also. But Priority Queue will efficient for us. Because we will enter patients with priority level . And our queue will be sorted by priority level . That is all we solved problem.  All common functions is same as queue methods. We can use priority queue many type of problems as I mentioned . 


## **HashSet<T>** 

Like another types it is resizable. It means if we add or remove element the size will be change automatically. HashSet is not ordered data type. So the elements which are inserted by us can not garantuated indexing. HashSet indexing doing with HashCode.HashSet can not give permission using same elements. Searching any element is very fast in HashSet’s. It is O(1). Methods of hashset.
1) Add is using to insert element. Return true and false value. If there is have a duplicate element return false else return true .
2) Remove is using for removing element .
3) Remove Where is using for deleting all elements which are is appropriate with our conditions.
4) Contains is same as stack ,queue method.

## **Conclusion** 
Priority have same idea as queue and stack . But In this data structure all items will have priority level
